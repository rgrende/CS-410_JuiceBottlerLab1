## Juice Bottler, Lab 1

This is the first lab of the operating systems course. 
This lab implements the idea of multithreading by the means of a juice bottling plant. In this particular plant, there are multiple workers. Each worker is assigned one of five jobs, fetcher, peeler, squeezer, bottler, and processor at the start of the program. Once the program is initiated, the workers are assigned a title and the fetcher, spawns an orange.

Nate Williams allowed us to use two files, Orange.java and Plant.java which I renamed to Plant. These two files along with my Worker.java file, which implements my worker class, make up the lab entirely. There is no  user input needed.
